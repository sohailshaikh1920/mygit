IAM

there mainly 3 types of authentication
Oauth 2.0 - app to app auth for specific resource or scope 

SSO
OpenID - build on top of oauth for user to app auth 
SAML - Security assertion markup language 

which one to be used to dependent on application or service provider


MS Entra
is single source of user base to maintain all identities,attributes,passwords
this is also source to O365 admin center and intune admin center
provide single source of authetication to MS and non MS based applications

Oauth 2.0 delegate user permission flow(any application auth with gmail)
allows application to access specific resource on behalf of an user (like service principle)

1. resource owner logins to specific application page and click on autheticate with identity system
2. application(client) contacts authorization server(gmail) with redirect uri
3. Auth server verifies your login and if not ask you to login 
4. auth server presents you consent form with requested scope if applicable like linkedin
5. auth server response thruogh redirect uri with temp auth code 
6. client contacts auth server directly not through owner browser and sends auth code,client id and secret 
7. auth server verifies the data and response with access token
8. client uses the access token to connect with resource server and get the required data within scope

OpenID or OIDC or SSO user permission flow

Open standard for decentralized authentication
ID token refers to JWT,JSON web token that can be decryted to find information like scope,expiration etc

OpenID is auth standard is same as oauth with additional information like ID token along with access token https://jwt.ms/

1. resource owner logins to specific application page and click SSO with identity system
2. application(client) contacts authorization server(Entra) with redirect uri
3. Auth server verifies your login and if not ask you to login 
4. auth server presents you consent form with requested scope if applicable like linkedin
5. auth server response thruogh redirect uri with temp auth code 
6. client contacts auth server directly not through owner browser and sends auth code,client id and secret 
7. auth server verifies the data and response with access token & ID token
8. client uses the access token & ID token to connect with resource server to complete login


types of SSO

SSO is federated identity management

SAML :
consider a scenario when you want to access any application so it does require your identity so there are 3 participants here
1. user
2. service provider (app)
3. identity provider (entra,okta,any ldap)

SAML flow :

1. user access app with try to auth with SSO
2. app generates SAML request and redirect it to IDP
3. IDP accepts the SAM request and validate wether user is authenticated already if yes then step 6 else step 4
4. IDP presents a login page to user 
5. user provide credentials
6. IDP provides SAML response token to user browser
7. user browser redirect SAML token to service provider
8. SP validates SAML response & token with the help of public key crytography
9. finally SP returns resources to user browser

OpenID
