DC and DNS architecture 

AZ FW will be used as central DNS forwareder system where FW policy DNS config will have ip address of DNS hosted DC either 
All vnet will have custom DNS as FW IP and FW will forward all DNS request to DC servers in Azure and if the record is not found then there will be forwarder pointing to internal DNS 168.63.129.16 and then it forwards it o either private or public Azure DNS

bastion host

use case is to have bastion host with public ip and then bastion host connect to vm inside private subnet so that
private vm's are not exposed to internet 
it required dedicated subnet with name AzureBastionSubnet /26 
understand bastion host to vm auth and connectivity in details??
NSG needs to have inbound rule to allow bastionshostsubnet on port 443
passwords stored in kv has to be selected to authorize connection
bastion will always have a public ip to be accessible from internet

command to check list of sku's in specific region

az vm list-skus --location eastus --size Standard_D --all --output table

can be deployed in VMSS
it has to be in same tenant id because end clients can't see bastion from another tenant
peering conection with other vnet can extend the connectivity

hub and spoke

hub : p-we1net
hubvnet: p-we1net-network-vnet

spoke : p-nwsadm
spokevnet : p-nwsadm-network-vnet

peering connection needs to be both ways so that traffic can flow bi-directional

eagress traffic from from nic to internet

nic->subnet->nsg(outbound)->RT->FW(virtual appliance)->application rule collection->internet -- statefull connection

ingress traffic from internet to nic

internet->waf->AAGW->listner->backend pool->FQDN\URI-->nsg(inbound)-->subnet-->nic


how AAGW is talking to backend pool vm\app service?
why managed identity is required in AAGW?

eagress traffic from nic to interanet

source nic->subnet(NSG)->RT->FW(virtual appliance)->network rule collection->nsg(inbound)->subnet->destination nic

Ingress traffic from interanet to nic

destination nic->subnet(NSG)->RT->FW->network rule collection->nsg(inbound)->subnet->source nic

CIDR decision?

log analytics workspace

same LAW can handle operational logs from Azure Monitor, azure sentinel and defender
LAW per region can save data ingestion cost
LAW should pe specific to each tenant because resurce from same tenant can inject logs to LAW
by default logs stored for 90 days

1. what is the default retention period of logs like activity log,resource log,storage account logs or NSG flow logs
90 days, but on LAW we can set based on our requirement and NSG flow logs is usually kept for 3 days max

2. does LAW require storage to be linked or it manages storage by its own
No it does not require storage account to be created, azure manages injections in LAW to TB

3. NSG flow log retentions vs analytics
3 days and for analytics logs are pushed to LAW

4. how azure monitor is integrated with LAW to pull data
Not yet clarified

5. Agnets MMA,AMA
to push logs to defined LAW

6. usecases to export log from LAW to storage account or event hub
nothing as such in montel

network hub and spoke architecture with Azure FW 

finally FW full speed my daud raha hai, ye procedure follow karo :

1. create vnet\subnet for hub and spoke
2. hub<-->spoke peering , spoke to spoke no peering
3. create route table for every subnet to point traffic towards virtual appliace(FW) and attach it to respective subnet
4. ensure to disable route propagation (detail me padho)
5. dnat rule kaam kiya tha for RDP when there was no inbound allow for RDP in NSG(check ke FW priority vs NSG priorty ka kya chakkar hai)
6. read about priority in FW and NSG in detail
