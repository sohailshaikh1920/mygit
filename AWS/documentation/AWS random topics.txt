AWS config

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of
recorded configurations against desired configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and
relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories,
and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.
This enables you to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting.

cross region Load balancing

To reach global users quickly or to meet the requirements of using a single public IP, AWS Global Accelerator can also be used for
cross-Region failover.AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves availability and performance for applications with
both local and global reach. AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application
endpoints, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Amazon EC2 instances in single or multiple AWS Regions.
 It uses the AWS global network to optimize the path from your users to your applications, improving performance,
 such as the latency of your TCP and UDP traffic.

 The Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow feature makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types,
 including latency-based routing, geo DNS, geoproximity, and weighted round robin—all of which can be combined with DNS Failover to
 enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures. The Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow simple visual editor allows you to
 manage how your end users are routed to your application’s endpoints—whether in a single AWS Region or distributed around the globe.
