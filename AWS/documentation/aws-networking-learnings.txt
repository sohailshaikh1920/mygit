VPC endpoints :
GW VPC endpoints
interface VPC endpoints
GW LB VPC endpoints


allows you to connect private subnet workloads to public S3 buckets and DynamoDB through AWS private network

GW VPC endpoints

for S3 and DynamoDB

drawbacks :

unable to use this from VPN and direct connect since it is not of VPC
wit is limited to same region and can not be extended to other region

VPC endpoint policy :

you can put restriction on top of existing access requestor has with the help of policy creation tool that generates json

3 level permissions can be applied based on diff requirement

EC2 IAM role for S3 access --> VPC endpoint policy --> S3 bucket level policy

Interface endpoint

EC2 IAM role for S3 access --> Security Group --> S3 bucket level policy
Supports DC & VPN

SQS

provider and consumer concept and helps in building loosely coupled systems
always use private DNS name for pointing to specific queue

how tcpdump works?
how vpc flow logs works?

Load Balancers :

ALB
layer 7 LB with http and https

path and host based routing

example.com/name/ - server01
example.com/address/ - server02

register ip as target
load balancing on multiple ports in same instance
set conditional response message in ALB if both conditions are not met

AWS adds features in conditional response regularly

listerner (alb name) --> target group --> servers

path(exampple.com/test/) & host(example.com) bases based routing

NLB

works on 4th layer , supports TCP protocols , ALB can see HTTP header but NLB can't
selects targets based on flow hash algo based on IP,dest port & tcp sequence number

CLB works oon standard round robin algo ,

NLB vs alb

NLB can process millions of request per second
you can use static elastic ip
both works almost same but key diff are ALB works on HTTP & HTTPS that helps conditional routing based on host,header,path etc but NLB
works on tcp

transmission control protocol keeps source and destination port details and internet protocol records IP details

ELB Access logs

sourceip , timestampp , type of request , content trying to open , http code , source browser details
you have to enable access logs explicitly to be stores in S3 and it takes 5-10 minutes to generate log
it doesn't provide all logging ingo but it helps to understand type of logging to elb
S3 bucket policy should be allowed to write object from AWS account where elb is deployed , its is better to create S3 bucket while creating
ALB so that policy is set correctly


DHCP

DHCP discover : new client added to network send this request to 255.255.255.255 broadcast address
DHCP offer : DHCP servers see discover request and offers avail ip address
DHCP request : client picks one ip and send request to aquire it if it is still available
DHCP AcK : server ack free ip address

to configure DHCP options in AWS create DHCP set in VPC tab put all required details like DNS server name, ip range,netbios name
NTP server and then attach it to vpc

check /etc/resolve.conf in ec2

Data packet travel from source to destination called as data encapsulation

1. Data raw size (L7)
2. TCP header includes source and destination port details(L4)
3. IP header source and destination ip details(L3)
4. ethernet header having mac details source and destination(L1,L2)
5. Data frame is complete packet with all details but the size will be more comparing to data raw size 

*** max data packet size is 64k byte wheras max MTU size 1500 byte hence the data packet will be fragmented and merged at destinaion

Understanding tcp

reliable ensures data transfer in same format between source and destination

3 way handshake

client to server : SYN (synchronize)
Server to client : SYN AcK
client to server : AcK

What happens when you request any website

1. public DNS is hit to resolve name and get public IP
2. once the IP is received 3 way handshake happens
3. get http starts with all details

Understanding MTU (maximum transmission unit)

defined as maximum size of IP packet that can be transfer in one network transaction
1500 MTU is standard across internet

intranet devices supporting jumbo frames can have 9000 bytes
AWS VPC have jumbo frames enabled for intranet connections
if you send packet more then 1500 bytes to internet then it will be fragmented to 1500 automatically by AWS

maximum segment size in TCP

MSS is the value after substracting IP & TCP header which is 20 bytes each

MSS = 1500 - tcpheader(20) - IPheader(20) = 1460

this u can find in wireshark output tcp under options

IP fragmentation

1. fragment the packet into smaller peices and send it to destination taken care by router
2. response ICMP packet too large

router has DF(don not fragment) bit set then it will not fragment else it will fragment but fragment on router is not a good practice

ICMP (internet control message protocol) is used for error reporting and diagnosis

IP Address reservations in AWS

max subnet is /16(65536) and min subnet is /28(16)
max 5 vpc per region
AWS has 5 reserved ip's

10.0.0.0 network Address
10.0.0.1 VPC router
10.0.0.2 VPC dns
10.0.0.3 VPC future use
10.0.0.255 VPC broadcast

IP address in subnet cannot overlap in vpc

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication

MPLS (multiprotocol label switching)

label based routing where each router assignes one label to every subnet and based on that packet reaches the destination

support ip,ipx protocols
label based lookup are faster compare to ip based

VPC peering

allows diff VPC to talk to each other on local ip's in diff or same region
ovelapping cidr blocks is not supported

VPC CIDR planning

10.0.0.0/16
172.16.0.0/16
192.168.0.0/16

max 5 CIDR is allowed but we can increase it to 50 with support request

Global accelarator

helps you to reduce response time on your webpage
oregon is having this service available
all hits comes to nearest edge location and then pointed to endpoints
endpoints can be ELB,EC2 or elastic ip


Web application Firewall

AWS sheild works on L3 & L4
WAF works on layer 7 because application cyberattacks happpen on L7 like HTTP

Statefull vs stateless FW

Pros of Stateful Firewalls
+ Stateful firewalls are highly skilled at detecting unauthorized attempts or forged messaging.

+ The powerful memory retains key attributes of network connections.

+ These firewalls do not need many ports open for proper communication.

+ Stateful firewalls offer extensive logging capabilities and robust attack prevention.

+ An intelligent system, stateful firewalls base future filtering decisions on the cumulative sum of past and present findings.

Cons of Stateful Firewalls
- Vulnerabilities may allow a hacker to compromise and take control over a firewall that is not updated with the latest software releases.

- Some stateful firewalls can be tricked to allow or even attract outside connections with an action as simple as viewing a webpage.

- Man-in-the-middle attacks may pose greater vulnerabilities.

Pros of Stateless Firewalls
+ Stateless firewalls deliver fast performance.

+ Heavy traffic is no match for stateless firewalls, which perform well under pressure without getting caught up in the details.

+ Stateless firewalls have historically been cheaper to purchase, although these days stateful firewalls have significantly come down in price.

Cons of Stateless Firewalls
- Stateless firewalls do not inspect traffic.

- The stateless firewall also does not examine an entire packet, but instead decides whether the packet satisfies existing security rules.

- These firewalls require some configuration to arrive at a suitable level of protection.


WAF deployment phases

Rule statement :

define exactly what is the condition that you want to enable\disable
like blocking all traffic from outside india
below are the custom config that you cann do

headers , http methd , query string,geolocation URI etc

there are predefined rules from AWS and marketplace

Rules in WAF :

define rule statement with condition like AND,OR,NOT

Association in WAF :

WAF can be associated with ALB,CloudFront,APIGW
can not be EC2

WEB ACL in WAF

centralized place for rules,statement and association

ACL capacity is 1500 and each ALB,CF,APIGW will have seperate WAF

regular and rate based rules are the 2 options

allow
block
count
captcha

AWS certificate Manager

SSL\TLS certificates provision,deploy,manage and all free of cost

VPC flow logs

record the traffic info coming to AWS resources like EC2,ELB,API GW etc & outbound traffic from AWS resource

VPC flow logs works at network interface level and below is the format of logs

DNS connectivity,windows activation & DHCP traffic is not captured here

VPN

is used to route traffic via VPN server IP, in AWS we can plave VPN in public subnet and connect it to get private subnet VM Access

managed services from aws

below are the 3 authentication approach in VPN
AD based
mutual authentication
SAML\single sing on


client.cert & server.cert

Client VPN supports certificate from ACM

procedure

create CA,server & client certifcate from git repo using EC2
Copy CA,server & client certifcate and asscoaited key to ACM
create client vpn endpoint
associate with subnets
authorization

architecture supported

client to vpc
client to vpc and then another vpc through vpc peering
client to vpn and then internet via internet gateway
client to client via vpn

site to site vpn\ipsec tunnel

Virtual private gw is used to built HA for tunnel

customer GW - create CGW with FW public ip
VPG : create VPG and attach it to specific VPC(only one VPC per tunnel)
VPN tunnel : create VPNT and define CGW & VPG and customer segment to advertise
download config file to be uploaded in customer FW
add route in VPC for customer subnet pointing towards VPG

static routing :

routes that you define for specific dest

route add -net dest GW 0.0.0.0 netwmast 0.0.0.0 dev devname

Dynamic routing

RIP
OSPF : open shortest path first
BGP : Broadway gateway protocol
AS : autonomus system is group of computer on internet it can be ISP or ent org

Direct Connect

consistent net perf
reduce bandwidth cost
internet connectivity between onprem to cloud

DC is free and only chargeable for transfer out data, transfer in us free and maybe third party partner charges if it is used

DC traffic towards diff resources

public interface : S3 & dynamodb
private int : EC2 and all in priavte subnet
transit int to connect resource in another VPC

once the DC is create AWS takes 3 days to share LOA(letter of auth) so that you can co-ordinate with AWS network hub team to
establish connectivity

Virtual private GW : allows connection to a single VPC in same region
Direct connect GW  : allows connection to multiple VPC and regions

Transit GW :

to connect multiple VPC,VPN and DC

below are the stages in TGW

1. attachement : (vpc,vpn,dc)
2. TG route table : each attachement will be associated with one RT
3. Association :   each attachement will be associated with one RT
4. route Propogation : VPC should have routes pointing towards TGW & VPN & DC will be propogated through BGP

TG peering

use to connecting multiple vpc,ipsec tunnels through TG

-- after you create peering attachement the owner to peer TG has to to approve it same as vpc peering
-- TG should have route towards peering TG
-- traffic is encrypted


content delivery network (CDN) :

offloading data caching in CDN
DDOS and WAF security features
WAF integration


AWS CloudFront :

can be associated with S3,EC2,ALB,Lamda etc

AWS CloudFront origin access identity

restrict user to access web page from CF only and no direct connection to origin S3,EC2

AWS CF signed URL
