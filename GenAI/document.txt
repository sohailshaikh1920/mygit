genai is based on dataset fed to LLM(large language model) this data is stored in neural network 
these LLM is trained to be less toxic with the help of humans RLHF(reinforcement learning without human intervention)

reoccuring neural network 
every work input is considered as one neural and chatgpt can take upto 3000 neural when you submit a string
in translator or in email that input is compared with neural data and suggestion provided based on matching 
probablity from 0-1 highest the probablity that becomes suggestion on your screen 

GenAI flow

GPT4 - LLM (large langua model) which is trained with many different datasources but its just a brain to use it you need other body parts like backend server(web servers) and it will use 
RAG(retrieval augmented generation) to pull information from LLM which is hosted in open AI cloud
