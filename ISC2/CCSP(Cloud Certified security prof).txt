Cloud computing charateristics

on-demand self service - opex and can be enabled by any professional
broad network access - always available network and resources
resource pooling - scalable,agile,use based,large resource pool
rapid elasticity - flexible to scale whenever needed, like electricity provider you get itemised bill

IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)

ISO/IEC 22123-1:2023
ISO/IEC 17788:2014 provides an overview of cloud computing along with a set of terms and definitions. It is a terminology foundation for cloud computing standards.

ISO/IEC 17788:2014 is applicable to all types of organizations (e.g., commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations).

type of destruction of digital data

physical destruction
magnetic desgausion
owerwrtting
crytographic erasure

threats to cloud storage
malware attack
unauth access
DOS & DDOS
Data leakage
Unauth usage
liablity due to regulatory noncompliance
corruption,modification or destruction of data
improper disposal after end of use
theft or accidental loss of media

types of data
structure
semi
un

data masking

Network function virtulization (NFV)
within cloud like fw,vnet gate,vnet

software defined network(SDN-WAN)
for WAN and internet connectivity

Management plane:
At this plane, all business applications that
manage the underlying control plane are
exposed with norhbound interaces

Control plane:
At this layer, control of network functionality
and programmability is directly made
to devices. OpenFlow was the original
framework/protocol speciied to interace
with devices through southbound interaces

Data plane:
The network switches and routers located
at this plane are associated with the
infrastructure. The process of forwarding
data is accomplished at this plane, so it can
also be referred to as a forwarding plane.
SD-WAN especially
supports WAN architecture
related to cloud migration.
The benefits of SD-WAN
implementations include:
Minimizing on-premises
hardware procurement and
management
Microsegmentation of traic
types (broadband, MPLS,
customer/corporate facing,
etc.) for greater perormance
Suppor for security integration
The modern virualization of networks and
the associated technology is called network
function virualization (NFV), alternately
referred to as virual network function.
