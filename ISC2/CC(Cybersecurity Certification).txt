Internation information secuirty certification (ISC2)

Chapter 1: Security Principles

Module 1 : understand security concepts 

CIA (Confidentiality,Integrity,availablity)

Confidentiality:
ensuring data is restricted to auth users and blocking uncomplianed devices
personal identifiable information and health information should always be protected or encrypted
data sensitivity by marking data classification

Integrity :
Data integrity, no unauthroize changes to data
system integrity, no unauthroize changes to system

Availablity :
Data and system is accessible all the time to authorized users and recovery procedures if system goes down
Criticallity by marking system hihn,medium,low

Authentication :
password
tokens
biometric

Methods of auth :

SFA (single factor) : password or pin
MFA : Password + pin

Non-repudiation :
Non-repudiation methodologies ensure that people are held responsible for transactions they conducted

GDPR :
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. 
Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations 
anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put 
into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will levy harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and 
security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros.

HIPAA :
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law that required 
the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed 
without the patient's consent or knowledge.

Module 1 : understand risk management process

vulnarablity :
gap in technical and physical security that can breach data

threat :
threat can be omeone exploiting vulnarablity to get unauth access

risk management is to understand threat wrt to vulanarblkity and mitigate risk as much as possible

Risk Management Terminology

An asset is something in need of protection.
A vulnerability is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts.
A threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts.

When determining an organization’s vulnerabilities, the security team will consider the probability, 
or likelihood , of a potential vulnerability being exploited within the construct of the organization’s
threat environment. Likelihood of occurrence is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the
probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or set 
of vulnerabilities.

In the world of cyber, identifying risks is not a one-and-done activity. It’s a recurring process of 
identifying different possible risks, characterizing them and then estimating their potential for 
disrupting the organization.  

Risk assessment is defined as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing risks to an
organization’s operations (including its mission, functions, image and reputation), assets, individuals,
other organizations and even the nation. Risk assessment should result in aligning (or associating) 
each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, 
assets or processes that the organization uses, which in turn aligns with or directly supports achieving
the organization’s goals and objectives. 

Risk treatment relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and 
prioritized risk. The decisions made are dependent on the attitude of management toward risk and the
availability — and cost — of risk mitigation. The options commonly used to respond to risk are:
