Types of DNS registeration in Azure :

1. private DNS with vnet link that registers and all records of vm's in that vnet and can be with vnet peering
2. host normal windows ad\dns in azure vm and create required records
3. DNS records from on prem
4. Azure AD domain services

when you create any resource in vnet there will be internal dns record created on idns 168.63.129.16

xyz.internal.cloudapp.net
xyz.east-us.cloudapp.azure.com - public

private DNS is global and can be used from any region

DNS :

public
private
internal
custom --> in azure vm,on prem,Azure ad dns

Azure App GW :

components :
frontend ip\dns
listner
rules
http\https settings
backend pool --> VM,VMSS,Webapp,on-prem server
need empty subnet of /24 to deploy AAPGW

flow :

client request site on hostname and translated to public ip through azure or any public DNS
IP belongs to AAPGW which then sends request to listners
listner makes connection with backend pool servers based on defined rules
then AAPGW make connection between user and backend system

Webapp :

set of infra with defined runtime and attached to service plan which defines what type of services you are going 
to get in webapp

when webapp is configured as backend pool it will have error since webapp has its own URL name and AAPGW dont 
change the host url when transmitting it to backend pool for that you need to overwrite the hostname from client 
request in http settings in AAPGW

WAF :

AAPGW
FrontDoor
Traffic Manager

can be applied on AAPGW,listner,route
lower level have bigger priority so if WAF allow is attached on listner and deny on AAPGW then allow will work

Security layers in Azure

Ingress:

NSG : NIC\subnet
WAF : AAPGW,FD,TM

Eagress:

Azure FW : subnet through static route
third party appliance like cloudguard 


Traffic Manager :

DNS based traffic load balancer
global service
can point to only public dns endpoint and endpoint can be vm webapp or onprem

priority based
if 1 is down then go to 2

performance based
go to nearest endpoint based on latency

geo based :
specific origin request can be pointed to specific target system

subnet based :
based on source ip

Routing services :

azure lb               AAPGW                  TrafficManager                FrontDoor           CDN

associated with vnet  yes                      no its a global service            no its a global service


FrontDoor :

global service works from edge location(point of presence location) to deliver content from least latency endpoint
combination of AAPGW & TrafficManager , like works on public endpoints and can do path based routing

https://www.azurespeed.com/Azure/Latency

can be mapped to

vm public ip FQDN
AAPGW
TrafficManager
API Manager
Web app
etc

waf policy is if then else statement which states that if condition matches then perform this else ok

NAT GW :

can be created for resources which doesnt have public ip associated for outbound connections and can be attached 
to subnet

user defined routes :

to route traffic through particular vm need to create route table,route and then attach it to subnet, enable ip 
forwarding so that ip packet can be passed from middleware vm and then add route inside OS as well,this usually 
required when there is appliance like cloudguard for eagress traffic.


Point to site VPN

1. create GW subnet recommended is /27,/28,/29
2. create virtual network GW and attached it to vnet and GW subnet
3. generate self signed root cert and then generate client cert from root cert
MS link to generate cert
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site

$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `
-Subject "CN=VPNroot" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
-HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
-CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign

New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -DnsName P2SChildCert -KeySpec Signature `
-Subject "CN=VPNClient" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `

-CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
-Signer $cert -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2")

create point2site config
download client and install in PC

authentication can be done through Azure AD by registering VPN as application

Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2)

Site-to-Site VPN

1. create virtual network GW and attached it to vnet and a public ip
2. configure local network GW that holds info about onprem public\CIDR & PSK(preshared key)
3. confgure connection in VNGW and attach it to LNGW
4. configure on-prem router with ikev2 vpn tunnel and add azure public\CIDR & PSK
5. Both side should have publically routable static IP
6. if you have multiple vnet then create peering connection while using existing VNGW
7. add new vnet CIDR details in on-prem router to start routing packets to new CIDR

awesome blogpost explaining virtual network gateway with p2s,s2s and ER circuit

https://blog.cloudtrooper.net/2023/02/06/virtual-network-gateways-routing-in-azure/

Azure virtual WAN :

1. centralized virtual overlay of all vnets and other azure resources
2. create hub in AVW that has all endpoints like VPN and ER circuit details

AVW is available in marketplace

basic : just S2S vpn
standard : P2S , S2S , ER , Vnet

when you virtual hub you dont need AVNGW and in hub itself you can add all vnets,P2S , S2S , ER
once you add vnets you will see peering connection in vnet

vnet peering within region is called vnetpeering but across region its globalvnetpeering

Expressroute :

dedicated 10GBPS MAX connection from on prem to MS edge location through service provider

ER to ER can be connected through ER global reach

SKU :

local : can connect one or two region within geo
standard : can connect to any region

NSG

ASG

Network Watcher

connection monitor : can monitor traffic between source\dest on perticular port vm's should have network watcher 
agent
IP flow log : source\destination port is open or not can be checked
next hop : is like tracert
connnection troubleshoot : can go to VM and check inbound\outbound traffic like telnet
NSG diagnostics : will give detailed view on top of ip flow logs
NSG flow logs : all logs going in\out NSG logs here need to be sent to storage account
Traffic analysis : flow logs will be seen here in graphical view that is stored in LAW

Security layer in azure

NSG
Firewall
WAF

Azure Firewall :

is a managed service to protect vnet, intelligent,statefull, highly available etc
to use it first create static route for subnet to go through FW for any destination
can create eagress rule for specific port\URL
it has to be in same region\RG as vnet
requires dedicated subnet

rulecollection group-priority
app rule-priority 
net rule-priority
dnat rule-priority


Service endpoint :

can be used to access public azure service via private vnet network\subnet travels through MSBBN

service endpoint policy :

can restrict to particular resource in public like specific storage account and rest storage account will be 
restricted

its a regional service

private endpoint :

here the public service is communicated through private ip from vnet attached to dedicated nic and there private 
DNS also created to add DNS records for public service

private link :

use case is when you want to expose few resource from one vnet to specific subnet in another vnet

application service region-1

vm's
LB
NAT GW
Private link

consumer region-2

private endpoint from private link in consumer region attached to consumer vm subnet
