Subscription :
agreement between client and Azure which states type of support and amount which charged

to get card details
subscription-->billing properties-->billing profile name
search billing profile

help & support :
to get the support plan

cost mgnt & billing :
for payment method and cost details

Resource group :

is a logical container and resources inside can be deployed to different regions , deleting RG means deleting 
all resource inside it so ideally resource should be protected by applying locks , one resource can belong to one 
RG

Azure limits :
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits

RG Naming :

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming

RG name cannot be changed

RG is associated with one region where it stores metadata but it can have resources from different regions

IAM :

Azure AD is default directory services provided when you create your account and all users and group will reside 
in AAD

RBAC :
role based access control
Account owner : global admin+billing admin+subscription owner
Owner : subscription owner and can share subscription with others
contributor : can create resource in subscription but cant share it
reader : read only
70+ predefined roles by azure

access can be given on subscription,RG,resource & management group is group of subscription to manage Access

Management Group :
group of subscription to manage access\authorization
can not delete mgnt group with subscription but after removing subscription you can delete it
nested mgnt group can also be done


global filters :
can be used to filter subscription in different views

MFA :
use MS auth app and sync your account

Availability Zone :

multiple DC in same region with separate supply

Availability set :

only one DC hence managing logical placement of VM's in multiple fault domains

Fault\update domains :

is a rack(max 3 in one AS)\host(max 20 in one AS) in DC with separate power supply

VM scale set :

is group of Load balanced VM's that can scale in\out based on demand

Proximity placement group :

Proximity placement groups allow you to group Azure resources physically closer together in the same region

Private IP range in Azure :

10.0.0.0/16
172.16.0.0/16
172.31.0.0/16
192.168.0.0/16

Vnet :

Virtual network in azure for private ip assignment
site24*7 calculator

reserved ip's in each subnet

192.168.0.0 - network ip
192.168.0.1 - default GW
192.168.0.2\3 - Azure dns
192.168.0.255 - broadcast ip

one vnet is limited to specific region

Microsoft automatically creates the Azure Network Watcher when you create or update an Azure virtual network in 
your subscription.Azure makes a resource group named NetworkWatcherRG that contains Network Watchers for each 
Azure region where it has deployed virtual networks
Every subscription can create up to 50 Virtual Networks across all regions


Azure VM types :

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes

Cost optimization :

stop button gracefully shutdown the vm and resources(ram,cpu,temp storage) are release but data luns is preserved
set auto-shutdown for specific time when you want to stop vm

VM components :

Disk
NIC
Public IP (public dns names can configured here)
NSG
Virtual Network
snapshot
ASG

After changing subnet vnic will be same but OS will get new vnic with new MAC

NSG :

packet is consist of 4 layers

frame : data
ethernet : src & dest mac address
IP : src & dest ip
TCP : src & dest port

rule priority is more for lower number eg 900 is precedent over 901
internet control message protocol -- ICMP

NSG can be associated with NIC for individual VM or subnet for set of VM's

ASG :

is a virtual grouping of VM's to enable communication in NSG with ASG names instead of IP

Disk :

default vdisk is 127GB & 30GB for windows and linux respectively
LRS : locally redundant storage which keeps 3 copy in one DC\AZ
temporary storage differs based on vm size and it is free
TS is used for paging\swap space

disk types

           Ultra disk	Premium SSD v2	Premium SSD	Standard SSD	Standard HDD
Disk type	 SSD	      SSD	            SSD	        SSD	          HDD
denoted by            P               P           E             s
OS          No        No              Yes         Yes           Yes


IOPS -- is the number of request (read\write) per second
throughput -- is the amount of data transfer\fetch per second

Locks :
can be on diff levels

subscription
RG
resource

type - delete (do not delete but changes to resources is allowed) , readonly (no delete no changes)
owner can delete lock

vdisk created on az1 cannot be attached to vm in az2

snapshot :

point in time read only copy of your disk
snapshot is kept at region level and you can create copy of disk in same region to any AZ
from snapshot you can create VM or disk and capture is used to create image (use sysprep for windows)
image is specific to region

Routing\route tables :

defult GW is router which helps in routing local traffic and internet
azure me route tables are not practically used and traffic is controlled with NSG
there are 2 default route one for vnet and one for internet 0.0.0.0/0
restriction between 2 subnets should be through NSG
default routes can be amended and it has to be on sybnet level

create new route table
create route towards 0.0.0.0/0 to point to none
map that rt to subnet

vnet peering :

Ip address range should be different to enable communication between 2 vnet
tcp packet depends on mtu size which 1500 bytes as standard practice and if the packet size is more than 1500b then
it will be fragmented
goto vnet and configure peering

VM cost calculation :

VM cost consist of OS+resources calculated per minute
OSdisk,datadisk,snapshot,image,publicip charges are seperate

reserved instance :

pay as u go - expensive per hour charges
1 year reserved - 51% discount
3 year reservation - 68% discount

vm size can be changed in same series to get reservation discount

azure hybrid benefit for windows server allows you to use on-prem license in azure
180 days license can be used between on-prem and azure during migration phase

Spot instance :

azure allows you to create vm's with 90% discount with temporary resource without any SLA within 30sec azure will 
take resources back,disk will be preserved if yoou chose stop\deallocate which can be used to create new VM

disk charges hourly bases

public ip prefix helps to assign series of public to target vm's

Azure backup :

status.azure.com to check service status in each region

Recovery service vault for backup and ASR

LRS : 3 copies in same DC
ZRS : 1 copy each in 3 DC in same region
GRS : LRS in primary and LRS secondary region

azure backup is snapshot of OS and data disk

soft deleting backup where azure keeps backup for 14 days for free

retain instance recovery snapshot - can't be zero -- chargeable

ASR :

for backup vault and vm should be in same region but asr vm and vault should be in target region
primary site caching storage account is created where all disk will be stored as staging and from there it will 
be replicated to secondary replica disk , replica disk snapshot is created every 5 minute for recovery point which
is retianed for 24 hours as per standard policy but can be changed

replication
failover
commit
create NSG\public ip and attach to target vm


Load Balancing in Azure :

front door or CDN
is an application delivery network that provides global load balancing and site acceleration service for web 
applications.It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application like SSL offload, path-based routing, fast 
failover, caching, etc.to improve performance and high-availability of your applications

Application Gateway
provides application delivery controller (ADC) as a service, offering various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities.
Use it to optimize web farm productivity by offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination to the gateway.

Azure Traffic Manager
is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing 
applications across the global Azure regions. Traffic Manager also provides your public endpoints with high 
availability and quick responsiveness.

Azure Load Balancer
is a high-performance, ultra low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP
protocols.It is built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. 
Azure Load Balancer is zone-redundant, ensuring high availability across Availability Zones.

types of ALB :

Standard Load Balancer
Equipped for load-balancing network layer traffic when high performance and super-low latency are needed.
Standard Load Balancer routes traffic within and across regions, and to availability zones for high resiliency.

Gateway Load Balancer
Easily deploy and scale virtual appliances with Gateway Load Balancer.
Enables scenarios that need service-chaining such as analytics, DDoS protection, firewall, and more.

Basic Load Balancer
Supports small-scale applications that don't need high availability or redundancy.

ALB can route within same vnet in same region

floating ip is used to map dynamic ip changes to ALB in failover\failback

Azure Traffic Manager :

is used route to multi region with DNS naming application through load balancer, every 30 sec checks endpoints 
health and caches local DNS for endpoint and TTL is 300 sec can be reduced to 5 sec but that with cost

flow :

user access abc.com and it checks on local DNS server
local dns server points to TM url
TM configured with endpoint vm\LB and TM caches the endpoint alias for configured TTL
user will be responded with nearest DNS server across diff geographies

VM scaleset :

configure scalein and scaleout based on your requirment

Storage Accounts :

blob(conatiner)
file(SMB file shares)
table(tabular data)
queue(message ques)

storage account is created in specific region and can be stand or premium

LRS : 3 copies in same DC
ZRS : 1 copy each in 3 DC in same region
GRS : LRS in primary and LRS secondary region
RA-GRS : read access on replicated region data

access tier :

hot .. frequently used data
cool .. less frequently used data

networking :

public endpoint (all network)
public endpoint(vnet\subnet)
private endpoint (vnic attached)

CDN :

azure uses akamai in backend for CDN for caching static pages,videos etc

Azure CLI(bash) :

check commands and examples online

Azure Powershell :

Azure AD connect :

vm will be deployed on-prem connected to local domain and saved as hash values for authentication
azure ad domain will always public so your onprem domain should be brought as public domain and add that public 
domain as custom domain in azure ad

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/identity/azure-ad


lab setup for SSO between on-prem to Azure and AWS

1. have created hennabynoor.com in private lab VM

6. user attributes first and last name is must to sync user between azure AD and AWS SSO
7. System from cross domain identity management (SCIM) record is synced in AWS SSO
8. Security assertion markup language(SAML) is user integration type between Azure AD and AWS SSO

types on autheticaition in coud platform :

1. AWS or azure platform level access, within platform administration,domain admin,subscription owner,contributor,
reader
2. System managed id which is associated with resource and lifecycle is with that specific resource
3. managed identity is independent of resource and lifecycle is managed with individual id
4. OS administrator and OS user
5. App to app authetication (API based)
6. serverless API GW authetication thorugh CIAM (token based)
7. HSM token based
8. Certificate based validation
