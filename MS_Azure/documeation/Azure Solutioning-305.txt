allows you to publish app on PAAS platform

Section 1 : Design Monitoring

Monitor :

azure monitor service can be used to create alert on logs,events etc

log analytics workspace :

agent based tool to move logs from azure vm or prem vm like syslog or splunk
provide great flexiblity and one stop for all azure logs and treated as resource in RG and worked as container for
diff logs, you can query different logs with predefined or you custom queries

NSG flow logs :

it can be enabled in network watcher and logs can be saved in storage account container

types of logs in azure :

VM events and log trails
NSG flow logs
ALB logs
SQL diagnostic logs
AD logs


Traffic Analysis :

can be enabled as part of flow logs and have to mapped with LAW and it will give graphical view of traffic on NSG 
selected

Service map :

have to install dependency agent on vm's , it can be used for mapping of all services with target VM like inbound
\outbound traffic and process etc.

SQL diagnostic logs :

can be enabled different types of logs and event for SQL DB and should be sent to LAW

AD logs :

diagnostic & sign in logs to LAW

can be used for azure on-prem or AWS resources
sentinal runs on top of LAW

Section 2 : Design Identity & Security

Types of identity in Azure :

Azure AD role
RBAC
PIM
Application object

Access & Authorization :

Azure AD is used for identity & subscription will be assigned with RBAC

Organisation chart :

tenant mgnt group
mgnt group+++
subscription+++
resourceGroup+++
resources+++++

RBAC and policies are inherited from mgnt group to subscription to RG to resource

subscription mapped with Azure directory :

in subscription you can choose which directory you want to access because there can be multiple directories

Role based access control(RBAC) :

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles

RBAC is associated with azure resource

Azure AD role :

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference

AAR is associated with azure AD operations

Azure AD Privileged identity management (PIM) :

You can use this service to provide just-in-time privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources
You can assign time-bound access resources using start and end dates
You can ensure an approval is sought before access is given
Ensure the user goes through the process of Multi-Factor Authentication to activate any role
Get notifications whenever a role is activated
See an entire history of role activations in the Azure account
Also conduct access reviews to see if users still need the required roles
This features requires the use of Azure AD Premium P2 licenses

Azure AD access reviews :

is part of PIM where you can start review for particular roles assigned to set of groups\users
you can identify user access and approve\deny it
you can see the activity logs for activity trails

Azure AD identity protection :

is tool to identify risk specific to user or sign ins
you can enable policy for users and signins to idetify risk
it works on logs collected by Azure to identify risk

Azure identity governance :

is a tool that can be used to review access for O365 and apps authenticated through azure
you can review access status and allow\deny access

MS Defender for cloud :

Performs a continuous assessment of your resources running in your environment
Secure Score –This helps to assess your current security posture. The higher the score the lower the risk
Recommendations –You get security recommendations on how to improve your environment
Alerts –You can also get alerts with enhanced security features

Defender JIT (just in time) vm access :

you can add vm to workload protection and enable JIT for specific duration & port
this will add one rule in NSG to block traffic on specific port but when you request access it add rule in NSG 
to allow Traffic


Azure identity protection  vs  Azure PIM                                            vs Azure JIT

detect user risk              time specific access for azure ad role and resources    specific to vm access part of
detect signin risk                                                                    azure security centre
authentication

MFA :

you can enable MFA for users

Conditional access policy :

Can be created from security in azure ad and it helps you to set controls for user\group for apps under azure
azure ad premium P2 license is required

Azure policy :

you can use predifined or custom policy to validate you environment eg vm backup should be enabled

Azure Blueprints :

Role assignments –If you need specific roles to be assigned
Policy assignments –This is if you need specific policies to be applied
Resource groups –If you need certain resource groups to be in place
Azure Resource Manager templates –If there are resources that need to be deployed

Stages:

Definition–Here you define the Blueprint itself. The Blueprint needs to be saved to either a management group or a subscription
When you save the Blueprint to a management group, the Blueprint can be assigned to any subscription which is part of the
management group
To save the Blueprint definition, you need to have Contributor access to either the management group or the subscription

Publishing–Once the Blueprint is defined, you can publish it. Here you can assign a version number for the Blueprint

Assignment–Here the Blueprint is then assigned to a subscription
You can protect resources deployed via the Blueprint resource locks
Here even if there is a user with the Owner role, still the user will not be able to remove the lock
You can only remove the lock by unassigning the blueprint

Application objects :

for an application to access and resource like storage account app object is created which can be used for RBAC 
roles to access any object and it can also be used as assume role for specific user accessing app and azure 
resources with same access

Azure key vault :

certificates
encryption keys
secrets(password)

AKV can be used to save passwords like OS administrator\sql db password, encryption keys and certificates

Managed identity :

it can be enabled on azure resource and then it is created as identity object in azure AD then go to
the resource to be accessed and assign required RBAC to that object like IAM role in AWS

encryption Keys :

you can encrypt vm disk with encryption key from key vault but KV and VM should be in same region

Azure AD domain services :

can be used to deploy AD on azure allows you to join domain,GP,LDAP,authetication
it creates 2 windows server domain controller
patching,azure backup and disk encryption can be virtual features

Section 3 : Designing data storage

types of storage in Azure :

1. storage accounts :
blob : objects videos,images etc
file : fileshares based on SMB protocol
table : noSQL database

2. SQL DB :

Oracle,MSSQL,MySql on VM
SQL PAAS where endpoint connectivity on internet but it can be assess via private\service endpoint
SQL managed instance which is deployed in vnet-preffered way

3. Fully managed NoSQL data store -- COSMOS DB :

4. Azure cache for Redis :

in memory DB

authorization of storage accounts :

Access keys (use MS storage account explorer)
Shared access signatures(use MS storage account explorer)
Azure AD

Storage account tiers :

hot
cool
archive

lifecycle rules
file can be accessed from hot or cool tier so if the file is archived it has to rehydreted means moving to 
hot\cool, cool tier is cost effective as compared to archive
cool tier data has to be 30 days and archive should be 180 else if you move then there will be early deletion fee

storage account encryption :

can be done with default encryption or azure key vault keys


Storage account access policy :

stored access policy : same as Shared access signatures
immutable(resource that are redeployed rather than change) blob storage : no changes will be allowed

Azure SQL :

IAAS :

You can use the Infrastructure as a service facility wherein you deploy Microsoft SQL Server on an Azure Virtual 
machine,This will give you complete administrative access over the virtual machine
Here you can also use the pay-as-you-go model when using SQL server on an Azure virtual machine
This provides an easy option for migrating your on-premise SQL Server workloads
Here you can install the version of SQL Server that you require
And then migrate the data onto the instance on the Azure virtual machine

PAAS :

Then you have the Platform as a service wherein you can use the Azure SQL database service
Here the underlying compute infrastructure is managed by Azure
Here you also get an SLA of 99.995%
With Azure SQL database server, you can choose from a variety of pricing tiers
Here you can also make use of features such as Automated backup, Automated tuning, simplified patching etc

Managed instance :

Azure SQL Managed Instance –This is an ideal option also for migrating existing SQL Server workloads onto Azure
SQL Managed Instance has near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server (Enterprise Edition) database engine
You can also get native Virtual Network Integration
You can also use the Hybrid benefits to use your own licenses to save on costs

SQL Auditing :

You can enable auditing for an Azure SQL database and also for Azure Synapse Analytics
This feature can be used to track database events and write them to an audit log
The logs can be stored in an Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace or Azure Event Hubs
This helps in regulatory compliance. It helps to gain insights on any anomalies when it comes to database 
activities,Auditing can be enabled at the database or server level
If it is applied at the server level, then it will be applied to all ofthe databases that reside on the server
DB and LAW\ASA should be in same region

SQL diagnostic :

diagnostic logs can be stored in storage account or LAW and control retention

SQL Data masking :

Here the data in the database table can be limited in its exposure to non-privileged users.
You can create a rule that can mask the data.
Based on the rule you can decide on the amount of data to expose to the user

There are different masking rules
Credit Card masking rule –This is used to mask the column that contain credit card details. Here only the last 
four digits of the field are exposed.
Email –Here first letter of the email address is exposed. And the domain name of the email address is replaced 
with XXX.com.
Custom text-Here you decide which characters to expose for a field.
Random number-Here you can generate a random number for the field.

Azure cache for redis :

in memory DB on SSD, frequently requested data from DB(COSMOS,SQL,storage account) can be written in redis by app

Azure COSMOS DB :

NoSQL DB but important to select right API based on DB is going to used :

SQL API
MondoDB API
Casandra
table
graph

can be replicated to multiple region as writable copy same as

Azure Data lake :

for storing and working on unorganised data from sources and extensions works on blob storage service

Azure databricks :

Azure Synapse :


Section 4 : Business continuity in Azure

SQL DB backup :

backup is available for IAAS and managed instances where backup itself can be LRBS,ZRBS or GRBS
restore can be done point in time,deleted db,regional restore for DR
backup can be retained upto 10 years in storage accounts

Locally-redundant storage (LRS) - Here data is replicated synchronously three times within the primary region.

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) - Here data is replicated synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
This is good when you want to have data present even in the event of a data center failure.

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) - Here data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region, then replicated
asynchronously to the secondary region.

Read access Geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) - Here data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region,
then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region. Here the data in the secondary region is also available for read-only purposes.

Remember when you decide to choose the replication strategy for a storage account as Read access Geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) ,
the storage service will decide on the secondary region.

Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) - Here data is replicated synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region,
then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region.

Read Access Geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) - Here data is replicated synchronously across three Azure availability
zones in the primary region, then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region. Here the data in the secondary region is
also available for read-only purposes.

Azure backup :

AB for vm can take one backup copy for a day and instance resovery snapshot is saved on VM and retention is saved 
on vault

Key vault :

can be replicated to paired region and it stores key,secret,certificates etc


Section 5 : Design Infrastructure

Azure VM vs Azure Web App

IAAS can install anything , you manage infra
PASS cannot install anything , no operation management,only for web based app based on specific application

Azure VM vs Azure functions

IAAS can install anything , you manage infra
PASS cannot install anything , no operation management,only for on-demand codes

Azure Batch :

can be use run batch jobs based on application or from specific application systems

Container deployement option :

1. Docker on VM
2. container on ACI
3. Container on AKS
